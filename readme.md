# Spring2DBML


Spring2DBML is a very simple tool that can produce a [DBML](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home) for a database declared in Java via the [Jakarta Persistence API](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/).

This tool is not feature complete by any means, it was created to get an overview over a database used in a personal project. This tool is thus limited to the features required for that use case.
